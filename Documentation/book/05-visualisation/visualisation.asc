== Visualisation

*LSDTopoTools* produces two main data types: raster data and point data. 
This chapter is a brief overview of ways to visualise these datasets. We go through some examples in the next chapter.

=== Using a GIS


* Raster data is output in ENVI bil format, which can be read by standard GIS software such as http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS] or https://www.arcgis.com/features/index.html[ArcMap]. 
* Point data is output as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values[csv] files. You can also choose to output these data as http://geojson.org/[geojson] files.
** To load csv files into a GIS, you will need to import them. Here are instructions http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/importing_spreadsheets_csv.html[for QGIS] and for http://support.esri.com/technical-article/000012745[ArcMap]. In both cases you will need to tell your GIS what coordinate system the data is in. *LSDTopoTools* writes latitude and longitude to our csv files in the http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/[WGS84] geographic coordinate system.
** Geojson files are *huge* compared to csv files but they can be used for web mapping (e.g., https://d3js.org/[D3.js] or http://leafletjs.com/[leaflet]), and they are georeferences socan be loaded directly into a GIS using the "add vector data" functionality.


=== Using python

We have a number of visualisation scripts built using https://www.python.org/[python] and its packages http://www.numpy.org/[numpy], http://pandas.pydata.org/[pandas], and https://matplotlib.org/[matplotlib].
