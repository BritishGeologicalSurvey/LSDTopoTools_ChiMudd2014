=== Output data formats

Data is written to either rasters or csv files. The rasters are all in `bil` format, which you can read about in the section: <<What data does LSDTopoToolbox take?>>

The **csv** files are comma separated value files which can be read by spreadsheets and GIS software. 
These files all have labeled columns so their contents can be easily views. 
All of the files contain **latitude** and **longitude** columns. These columns are projected into the **WGS84** coordinate system for ease of plotting in GIS software.
