=== Output data formats

Data is written to rasters, csv files, or geojson file. 

* The rasters are all in ENVI `bil` format, which you can read about in the section: <<Preparing your data>>. 
+
IMPORTANT: ENVI bil should not be mistaken for ESRI bil. Make sure you are using ENVI bil format.

* The **csv** files are comma separated value files which can be read by spreadsheets and GIS software. 
** If you import csv files into a GIS you need to tell the GIS about the coordinate system.  
** Our csv files all have labeled columns so their contents can be easily views. 
** Almost all of our csv files contain **latitude** and **longitude** columns. These columns are projected into the **WGS84** coordinate system for ease of plotting in GIS software. Select this coordiante system when you loa the csv file into your GIS. For reference it has the http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/[EPSG code 4326].

* It is very annoying to have to click buttons in a GIS to select a coordinate system each time you look at csv data, so we also allow you to convert to http://geojson.org/[geojson] format by using the flag `convert_csv_to_geojson` in the parameter file. 
** The advantage of these files is that they have georeferencing, so you can load them directly into a GIS or web mapping software. 
** The disadvantage is that they are *HUGE* compared to csv files (usually more than 10x the file size). If you are working within GIS software or using web mapping (e.g., https://d3js.org/[d3.js] or http://leafletjs.com/[leaflet]) you will probably want to generate these files but if you are using our python plotting tools you can probably forgo creating them.
