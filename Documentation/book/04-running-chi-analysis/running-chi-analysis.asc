== Running the chi analysis

The chi analysis, and a host of other analyses, are run using the *chi_mapping_tool.exe* program. If you followed the instructions in the section <<Getting the software>> you will already have this program compiled. 

The program *chi_mapping_tool.exe* runs with two inputs when you call the program:

1. The path to the parameter file. This **MUST** inculde the trailing slash (i.e., `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data` is incorrect whereas `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data/` is correct).
2. The name of the parameter file.

So if the parameter file is located at `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data` and it is called `test_chi_map.param`, you run the program with:

[source,console]
-----
$ ./chi_mapping_tool.exe /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data test_chi_map.param 
-----

As we will see momentarily, the data and the parameter file can be in different locations, although in general it might be sensible to place the parameter file in the sample directory as the data.

The code is run using a parameter file, within which users can set the data they want to print to file. Regardless of which data they choose to print to file, a file will be printed with the extension `_Input.param` which prints out all the parameters used in the analysis (including the default parameters). This file can be used to verify if the correct parameters have been used in the analysis.
