== Examples of chi analysis

We will now run some examples of chi analysis using the the *chi mapping tool*. 

WARNING: We are going to assume you are using our vagrant setup. That means that code will live in the directory `/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTool_ChiMudd2014` and topographic data will live in the directory `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects`.

=== Get the example data

We have placed several example datasets in the github repository https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_chi_examples[LSDTT_chi_examples]. You can clone these in your vagrant box into the `Topographic_projects` folder:

[source, console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_chi_examples.git
----

=== First example: Basic DEM steps

First we will do some very basic extraction of basins and visualisation of a region near Xi'an China, in the mountains containing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hua[Hua Shan].
