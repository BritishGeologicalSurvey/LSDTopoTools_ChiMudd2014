== Introduction

This section explains the theory behind analysis of channels using both slope-area analysis and chi analysis. If you just want to run the software skip ahead to the section <<Getting the software>>.

=== Background

In the late 1800s, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grove_Karl_Gilbert[G.K. Gilbert] proposed that bedrock channel incision should be proportional to topographic gradients and the amount of water flowing in a channel.

[quote, G.K. Gilbert,Geology of the Henry Mountains 1877]
We have already seen that erosion is favored by declivity. Where the declivity is great the agents of erosion are powerful; where it is small they are weak; where there is no declivity they are powerless. Moreover it has been shown that their power increases with the declivity in more than simple ratio.

Since then, many geomorpholgists have attempted to extract information about erosion rates from channel profiles.
Chi analysis is a method of extracting information from channel profiles that attempts to compare channels with different discharges first proposed by Leigh Royden and colleagues at MIT.
https://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools] has a number of tools for performing chi analysis.

This document gives instructions on how to use the segment fitting tool for channel profile analysis
developed by the Land Surface Dynamics group at the University of Edinburgh.
The tool is used to examine the geometry of channels using the integral method of channel profile analysis.
For background to the method, and a description of the algorithms, we refer the reader to
