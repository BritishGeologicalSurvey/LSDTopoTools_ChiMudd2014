This folder contains source code for the Chi analysis tools described in http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JF002981/full[Mudd et al (2014), open access].

This code is part of the http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools software package].

The versions here are updated on a semi regular basis. 

For instructions, go to the http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/[LSDTopoTools documentation website].

Instructions specific to this package are in the http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_chi_analysis[chapter on chi analysis]

== Quick Guide

If you are already familiar with this software, here as a quick reminder:

. Clone this repository (or, if you have already cloned it, `pull` any updates. 
. Navigate into the *driver_functions_MuddChi2014* folder.
. Compile the code using `make`:
+
[source, console]
----
$ make -f chi_step1_write_junctions.make
$ make -f chi_step2_write_channel_file.make
$ make -f chi_get_profiles.make
$ make -f chi_m_over_n_analysis.make
----
+
. Put your data and the parameter file (see http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_steps_involved_to_perform_channel_analysis[the section on steps for chi analysis])
into an appropriate folder. 
. Use *./chi1_write_junctions.exe* to find the junctions and *./chi2_write_channel_file.exe*
. You can perform m/n analysis or just get chi profiles using the other programs.
